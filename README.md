## 如何使用 Flutter 包和插件

官网:

- [Dart Packages](https://pub.dev)
- [Flutter Color Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_color_plugin#)

Use this package as a library
### 1. Depend on it
Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```
dependencies:
  flutter_color_plugin: ^0.0.2
```

### 2. Install it
You can install packages from the command line:

with Flutter:

```
$ flutter pub get
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

### 3. Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```
import 'package:flutter_color_plugin/flutter_color_plugin.dart';
```
